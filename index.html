      <div class="about">
        <p>I started making cheesecakes a few years ago just for fun, but it turned into a passion when I saw how people enjoyed them. When I had friends and family asking where I bought them from, or ordered them from, I realized I have a talent for something that made a lot of people happy. That's why I created Cheesecakes By Jon.</p>

        <p>Our cheesecakes are always fresh, never frozen, and made especially for you. We can accommodate most any order, whether you choose something from our regular menu, or have a special idea in mind. I'm always playing with new ideas, and if you have a special request, don't hesitate to ask. For any cheesecake order, please allow at least 72 hours notice. For orders of 3 or more, please allow 7-10 days notice.</p>
